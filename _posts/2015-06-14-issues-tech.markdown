1. What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges? --I enjoy pairing with others, so far, I've only had good experiences, and solving problems with a pair, is a good opportunity to learn new methods from each other.

2. Was something particularly fun or rewarding? --When we get on the same page right away, and just fly through a challenge, I really like when this happens, it makes it seem like we're both on top of things.

3. Was something frustrating and difficult for you? --So far, I've only had pleasant experiences with my pairs, I feel like i've been heard, and I like to give my partner the same respect.
