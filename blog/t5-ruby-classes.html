      So, How about Classes? Classes in Ruby, like everything else, are an object. Classes let you define variables and methods that you can reuse over and over again. One way to do this, is to use instance variables, instances variables are essentially a copy of the Class template with all of the general information filled in. instance variables are prefaced with the @ symbol, and you can call them on anywhere within the class.
