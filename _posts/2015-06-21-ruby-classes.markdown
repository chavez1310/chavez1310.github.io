<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o, How about Classes? Classes in Ruby, like everything else, are an object. Classes let you define variables and methods that you can reuse over and over again. One way to do this, is to use instance variables, instances variables are essentially a copy of the Class template with all of the general information filled in. instance variables are prefaced with the @ symbol, and you can call them on anywhere within the class.</p>

As we've been going along learning Ruby, we've been working with various types. Numbers, strings, arrays, and hashes. We haven't gotten too far along into what they actually are under the hood though. Although we've been calling these types, Ruby calls these things classes. The types that we've been using so far are all built into Ruby and come along with it when you download or install Ruby as part of Ruby's core API.

We're not limited to working only with the built in classes that Ruby provides for us. We can also create our own. Why would we wanna do this? Well, I'm so glad you asked. As we're going along creating a program, it can be cumbersome to remember each small nuanced part of what we're working with and remember those parts in terms that computers understand. We start to abstract that away using representations of things we're used to in the real world. These representations are called classes.

You can think of a class as a blueprint. The blueprint tells Ruby how a class should be structured and what it should do. For example, a blueprint of a car would show how a car can be made. What it doesn't do is get into the specific details about an individual car, like the color.
