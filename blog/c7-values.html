Considering a time in my life when I've been the happiest, proudest and most satisfied, I'd say the following values come to mind:

Family
Accomplishment
Helping others
Persistence
Integrity
Honesty
Self-respect

I do live by a code, even though I think it's super lame to say that you live by a code. I have a set of guidelines I created for myself, that I like to follow in order to be the best possible person I can be. My family is very important to me, and I make it a daily effort to keep in touch with them. I try and do the best I can, because they deserve it, and more. I try to accomplish things, this lets me know that I'm on the right track, and doing things the right way.



I do feel a bit of satisfaction at looking at my values, and knowing that I do live up to them. If I find myself feeling down at DBC, I'd probably take a step back, look at where I am, where I cam from, who i've become, and where I'm going and feel a bit better, this has always worked.
