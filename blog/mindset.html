      After taking the personal thinking style quiz, my learning results indicate that I have an abstract sequential (AS) learning style. Now, after reading material on AS, I can definitely agree with this assessment. AS learning style people follow traditional procedures, can work alone, use reading references and expert sources, among other things. I definitely fit in here.

        So far in DBC, my learning style has be relevant, in that I do quite enjoy working on things for long periods of time on my own, and like that whenever I run into a problem there is a wealth of useful resources and information both at DBC and on the internet. The biggest struggle for me so far has been my reluctance to write code that I think will be incorrect, and just get stuck on a problem without attempting it for long periods of time. Until now, I did not realize that this might have to do with my learning style, now that I think it might be, I can do more to try and correct it.

        Growth and fixed mindset are important factors to consider when leraning new material. People with growth mindset do believe they can learn and get better, and are not deterred by momentary failures, while people with a fixed mindset believe that they know what they know, and do not attempt things they do not believe they will be good at. I have a growth mindset, I do not take failure lightly, but am not deterred by it, I believe I can learn anything, and can be anything, if I decide to set my mind to it.
