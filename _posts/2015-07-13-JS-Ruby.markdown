<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o JavaScript, after spending a few weeks getting familiar with Ruby, this week, we took a look at a new language, you guessed it, JavaScript. Now, I know you're probably thinking, "Hey! You just started learning one programming language, now you're going to start learning a second?! Who do you think you are?!" To that I say, hey man, it wasn't my idea, and also, why do you care so much, and how did you get to my blog?

I'm going to write about some of differences I've noticed between the tow languages so far, so bare with me...

Iteration. It has tons of uses, but it pretty much comes down to going through an array or other enumerable object and doing something with each item.In Ruby, there are many ways to do this, but the most common way is by using iterators and blocks.

In JavaScript, there are also a few different ways to iterate through an enumerable, but so far, I have found the easiest way to do so is by using the for loop.
