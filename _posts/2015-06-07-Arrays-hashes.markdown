<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>rrays and Hashes are, from what I can tell so far, similar, but still very different aspects of Ruby. For one thing they are both indexed collections, and both collections of objects can be accessed using a key. However, with arrays, the key you use to access the value in the array is an integer, while with hashes you can assign keys yourself, and call the value by calling the key.</p>

Arrays are stored in curly brackets, are usually assigned to a variable, and you can access each individual value by calling the variable name, followed by the index number of the value. Each value is assigned an index value starting from 0 onwards, meaning the first value is 0, the second value is 1, the third value is 2, and so on.

Hashes are stored n square brackets. With hashes, you have a little bit more flexibility, as you can assign the key to the value, you might want to do this if you want to keep pairs together, like if you have pro basketball players as values, and you want to assign their key as the team they play for.
