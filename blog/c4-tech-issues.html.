      The tech industry is a relatively new field, I mean computers really weren't really accessible until the 90's, so as a nascent industry, it's bound to run into a few problems early on. One of said problems is diversity, it seems the early members of the tech industry are a pretty homogenous group, consiting of males who are mostly White or Asian. Now, this is understandable to some degree, technology is an expensive field to break into, making it difficult for members of other ethnic backgrounds to break into. As a member of an ethnic background who is underrepresented in tech, I can tell you that growing up, a career in tech wasn't even acknowledged as a possibility, and I didn't even know what computer science was until I got to college!

        One of the things the tech industry can do to try and improve gender and racial equality is to provide female and minority entrepreneurs with access to funding models that reduce gender and racial bias.
