        The benefits of version control are many, they help teams collaborate on projects, allow individuals to work on code, without the fear of overwriting their previous work, and it helps people check the history of their code, among other things.

        When working in teams, it helps to have a version control system in place, like git. Without one, teams have to manage working on the same code, at the same time, this means they run the risk of writing over each other's code, and really messing things up for themselves. With a version control system in place, teams do not need to worry about writing over each other's code, here each team member can work on their code individually, and when they are finished, can use a pull request, which is essentially a person asking his boss to check over his code, before incorporating it to the main code. This way, code is always protected from accidental overwrites.

        Teams aren't the only ones who can take advantage of the benefits of version control. Individuals can benefit from version control in many ways, like having comfort in knowing that you have access to previous versions of your code, this pretty much means that no matter how bad you messed up a piece of code, you can always go back to a time when you hadn't.

        Git helps a user keep track of his/her changes by allowing the user to write a message with each commit, this way, the user can go back and read what their messages said, and choose the point in time where they would like to look at their code.

        Github is widely used, you can find so many projects on their, and even contribute to some. Simply put, you should store your code on Github because of its cost (free), it gives you the ability to make as many repositories as you'd like, and because it isn't so difficult to learn how to use.
