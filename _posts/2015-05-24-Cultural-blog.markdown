<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>  knew what I was getting into when I applied to Dev Bootcamp, I researched so many other coding bootcamps, and chose DBC. After watching Shareef's fireside chat, my take on DBC remains the same, not only are they trying to give students the tools they need to begin working in software, but DBC also intends on giving everyone a trully formative experience.</p>

My impression with DBC, is that students are expected to take an active role in their education, for me this is a nice change of pace, I look forward to participating in such a place. I see myself taking Shareef's advice, and really pushing myself to make the most of it, I plan to ask lots of questions, answer them when I can, and contributing to a really creative atmosphere.

I have this nervous excitement flowing, I feel anxious to learn, and excited to start this path. The only thing I'm nervous about, and Shareef spoke about it in the video, is holding my cohort back, I'm new to coding, and I know their are going to be people with more experience than me in my cohort, so I really am going to give it my all, and not be that guy.
