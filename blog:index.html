          </h3>
          <p>The benefits of version control are many, they help teams collaborate on projects, allow individuals to work on code, without the fear of overwriting their previous work, and it helps people check the history of their code, among other things...</p>

          </h3>
          <p>I knew what I was getting into when I applied to Dev Bootcamp, I researched so many other coding bootcamps, and chose DBC. After watching Shareef's fireside chat, my take on DBC remains the same, not only are they trying to give students the tools they need to begin working in software, but DBC also intends on giving everyone a trully formative experience...</p>

          <h3><a href="http://chavez1310.github.io/blog/t2-css-design.html">Relative, Absolute, and Fixed positioning?</a></h3>
          <p>This week during phase 0 of DBC, we studied html and css. HTML and CSS are used pretty much all websites, so it's pretty important to know these well. One of the things I had trouble with while building my own website, and cloning another was positioning, how was I supposed to get these blocks of pixels exactly where I wanted them?...</p>

          <h3><a href="http://chavez1310.github.io/blog/t3-arrays-hashes.html">Arrays and Hashes</a></h3>
          <p>Arrays and Hashes are, from what I can tell so far, similar, but still very different aspects of Ruby. For one thing they are both indexed collections, and both collections of objects can be accessed using a key. However, with arrays, the key you use to access the value in the array is an integer, while with hashes you can assign keys yourself, and call the value by calling the key.</p>

          <h3><a href ="http://chavez1310.github.io/blog/mindset.html">Mindset</a></h3>
          <p>      After taking the personal thinking style quiz, my learning results indicate that I have an abstract sequential (AS) learning style. Now, after reading material on AS, I can definitely agree with this assessment. AS learning style people follow traditional procedures, can work alone, use reading references and expert sources, among other things. I definitely fit in here.

          <h3><a href ="http://chavez1310.github.io/blog/t4-enumerable-methods.html">Enumerables</a></h3>
          <p>In the simplest possible terms I could put it in, the enumerable method group_by pretty much just breaks a collection into groups bsed on a given criteria. When you use group_by, what is expected is a block containg the criteria by which the items are going to be grouped, and it returns a hash in which each key represents a groups, and the values are the corresponding arrays containing the members of the group.</p>

          <p>The tech industry is a relatively new field, I mean computers really weren't really accessible until the 90's, so as a nascent industry, it's bound to run into a few problems early on...</p>
