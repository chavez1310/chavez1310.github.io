<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>sking questions is a vital part of learning. Knowing how to ask a good question can be the difference between receiving a helpful answer and not. Now that the onsite portion of DBC is about to begin, it is as good time as any to learn how to ask good questions, I have a feeling I'll be asking a lot of questions in the next few weeks.</p>

When posting questions on a forum, or other online place, a good place to begin proper question asking technique, is with the title. If you don't have a good title, you aren't likely to get many people to read your question, and therefore few people are going to take an interest in answering your question. When writing your title, you should think about summarizing a specific problem in one sentence. Include details, error messages, key APIs, or unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions. If you're having trouble coming up with a good title, move on to writing the actual question, and come back to the title when you're done.

Now the actual question, make sure you include what language and platform you are using, any constraints that would prohibit you from using certain tools or methods. To paint a better picture to your readers, you should describe what you've already done, people are more likely to help you, if you can demonstrate that you've performed a certain amount of "due dilligence".

Make sure you have written a clear problem statement, if at all possible, write a sort of "executive summary" at the start of your question, followed by a more detailed description. Remember that on the list of questions, the first few sentences will appear as a snippet. If you can get a sense of the question across in that snippet, you're more likely to attract views from people who can answer the question.

If you can, provide some sample code.
