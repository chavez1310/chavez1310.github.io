      So, the stereotype threat... yes it's real. As a member of the underrepresented group in both tech and the legal field, I can't recall the amount of time my peers have decided against doing something great, because of the fear they have of not belonging.

       Growing up in a Latino neighborhood, I've met plenty of young people who were brilliant, but who end up dropping out high school or college, and working dead end jobs. From the conversation I've had with friends and family, I believe they end up leaving school, and not reaching their potential because they fear not fitting in, or they fear being ostracized from their social group.

      After reading a bit about what Dr. Steele, and his research, I can totally see where he is coming from, and understand what he means when he says, “If you care about what you are doing, the prospect of being judged is upsetting and distressing and disturbing,” he said. “In a situation like this, it takes cognitive resources away from a relaxed engagement with the task at hand and that undermines your performance.”

      Personally, I used my ethnicity as fuel, in college I always had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder, like if I had something to prove to everyone, and I was eager to represent well. I was usually one of only a handful of Latinos/as in lectures, and usually the only one in smaller classes, I remember making sure to always pronounce my name in Spanish, whenever someone would ask it, I wanted everyone to know that their was a Latino in class who was just as smart and capable as the best of them.
