    <h1> I'm from...</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in Chicago, and raised in the neighboring town of Cicero, IL. Now, you may not have heard of Cicero, but it was the home of some well known historical figures, for instance, Cicero was home to Al Capone, the birthplace of Ernest Hemingway (although that part of town has since ceded into Oak Park), and the birthplace of fictional character Jimmy McGIll (Saul Goodman), of Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul.

    <h1>Interests/Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I enjoy a variety of activities, but I have to say, my favorite thing to do/watch is soccer. It is in my blood, i've been playing and watching the game since the day I was born. My favorite club team is Chivas de Guadalajara in Mexico, I'm not sure I can describe what this team means to me, so I won't even try, haha. Other than soccer, I also am a fan of boxing, and have been involved in the sport for a number of years. Besides sports, I enjoy listening to some rocking tunage, my alal time favorite band is The Strokes, I'm also partial to Radiohead, The Smiths, Velvet Underground, among many many others.

    <p>
      I am a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, were I studied Political Science, and Latin American and Carribean Studies. I am also currently enrolled at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, where I will earn a J.D. degree when I get around to completing the 30 credit hours I need to graduate.
