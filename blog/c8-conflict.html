      Everyone has had conflicts, they are an inevitable result of living in communities and interacting with people. Dealing with conflicts can be tricky, I believe the best thing you can do in order to avoid an escalation of conflict, is to be completely honest, and resolve thing amicably.

<p>
  I've had my share of conflicts in the past, most of the time I've bee able to diffuse the situation, but on some occassions, emotions may have gotten the better of both parties.
</p>

<p>
  One conflict I remember having was with a teamate of mine a while ago. We were both on a soccer team that was underachieving, however I think it was safe to say that we were the two of the better players in the league. I played as a central midfielder, and he was a striker. One day during practice, our coach had us scrimmage, after a few minutes of playing it became evident that he didn't want to pass the ball to anyone on his team, and he would demonstrate his anger whenever he didn't get the ball.
</p>

<p>
  After our scrimmage, I decided to talk to him, to see what was up. he reponded by saying that he didn't want to pass the ball, because if he did, they would lose possession, because everyone on the team "sucked".
</p>
<p>
  Eventually, he left the team, and we were able to build better team spirit, and started winning games, as players on our tema started to improve.
